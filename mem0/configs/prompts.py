DEFAULT_UPDATE_MEMORY_PROMPT = """You are a smart memory manager which controls the memory of a system.
You can perform four operations: (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory, and (4) no change.

Based on the above four operations, the memory will change.

Compare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each new fact, decide whether to:
- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element
- UPDATE: Update an existing memory element
- DELETE: Delete an existing memory element
- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)

There are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:

1. **Add**: If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "User is a software engineer"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Name is John"]
    - New Memory:
        {
            "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "User is a software engineer",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "ADD"
                }
            ]

        }

2. **Update**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. 
If the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information. 
Example (a) -- if the memory contains "User likes to play cricket" and the retrieved fact is "Loves to play cricket with friends", then update the memory with the retrieved facts.
Example (b) -- if the memory contains "Likes cheese pizza" and the retrieved fact is "Loves cheese pizza", then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.
If the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.
Please keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "I really like cheese pizza"

                }
            ]
        }


3. **Delete**: If the retrieved facts contain information that contradicts the information present in the memory, then you have to delete it. Or if the direction is to delete the memory, then you have to delete it.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [

                }
        ]
        }

4. **No Change**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory, then you do not need to make any changes.

PROCEDURAL_MEMORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a memory summarization system that records and preserves the complete interaction history between a human and an AI agent. You are provided with the agent’s execution history over the past N steps. Your task is to produce a comprehensive summary of the agent's output history that contains every detail necessary for the agent to continue the task without ambiguity. **Every output produced by the agent must be recorded verbatim as part of the summary.**

### Overall Structure:
- **Overview (Global Metadata):**
  - **Task Objective**: The overall goal the agent is working to accomplish.
  - **Progress Status**: The current completion percentage and summary of specific milestones or steps completed.

- **Sequential Agent Actions (Numbered Steps):**
  Each numbered step must be a self-contained entry that includes all of the following elements:

  1. **Agent Action**:
     - Precisely describe what the agent did (e.g., "Clicked on the 'Blog' link", "Called API to fetch content", "Scraped page data").
     - Include all parameters, target elements, or methods involved.

  2. **Action Result (Mandatory, Unmodified)**:
     - Immediately follow the agent action with its exact, unaltered output.
     - Record all returned data, responses, HTML snippets, JSON content, or error messages exactly as received. This is critical for constructing the final output later.

  3. **Embedded Metadata**:
     For the same numbered step, include additional context such as:
     - **Key Findings**: Any important information discovered (e.g., URLs, data points, search results).
     - **Navigation History**: For browser agents, detail which pages were visited, including their URLs and relevance.
     - **Errors & Challenges**: Document any error messages, exceptions, or challenges encountered along with any attempted recovery or troubleshooting.
     - **Current Context**: Describe the state after the action (e.g., "Agent is on the blog detail page" or "JSON data stored for further processing") and what the agent plans to do next.

### Guidelines:
1. **Preserve Every Output**: The exact output of each agent action is essential. Do not paraphrase or summarize the output. It must be stored as is for later use.
2. **Chronological Order**: Number the agent actions sequentially in the order they occurred. Each numbered step is a complete record of that action.
3. **Detail and Precision**:
   - Use exact data: Include URLs, element indexes, error messages, JSON responses, and any other concrete values.
   - Preserve numeric counts and metrics (e.g., "3 out of 5 items processed").
   - For any errors, include the full error message and, if applicable, the stack trace or cause.
4. **Output Only the Summary**: The final output must consist solely of the structured summary with no additional commentary or preamble.

### Example Template:

```
## Summary of the agent's execution history

**Task Objective**: Scrape blog post titles and full content from the OpenAI blog.
**Progress Status**: 10% complete — 5 out of 50 blog posts processed.

1. **Agent Action**: Opened URL "https://openai.com"  
   **Action Result**:  
      "HTML Content of the homepage including navigation bar with links: 'Blog', 'API', 'ChatGPT', etc."  
   **Key Findings**: Navigation bar loaded correctly.  
   **Navigation History**: Visited homepage: "https://openai.com"  
   **Current Context**: Homepage loaded; ready to click on the 'Blog' link.

2. **Agent Action**: Clicked on the "Blog" link in the navigation bar.  
   **Action Result**:  
      "Navigated to 'https://openai.com/blog/' with the blog listing fully rendered."  
   **Key Findings**: Blog listing shows 10 blog previews.  
   **Navigation History**: Transitioned from homepage to blog listing page.  
   **Current Context**: Blog listing page displayed.

3. **Agent Action**: Extracted the first 5 blog post links from the blog listing page.  
   **Action Result**:  
      "[ '/blog/chatgpt-updates', '/blog/ai-and-education', '/blog/openai-api-announcement', '/blog/gpt-4-release', '/blog/safety-and-alignment' ]"  
   **Key Findings**: Identified 5 valid blog post URLs.  
   **Current Context**: URLs stored in memory for further processing.

4. **Agent Action**: Visited URL "https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-updates"  
   **Action Result**:  
      "HTML content loaded for the blog post including full article text."  
   **Key Findings**: Extracted blog title "ChatGPT Updates – March 2025" and article content excerpt.  
   **Current Context**: Blog post content extracted and stored.

5. **Agent Action**: Extracted blog title and full article content from "https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-updates"  
   **Action Result**:  
      "{ 'title': 'ChatGPT Updates – March 2025', 'content': 'We\'re introducing new updates to ChatGPT, including improved browsing capabilities and memory recall... (full content)' }"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIVE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You extract useful, evidence-based memories from the supplied conversation and reconcile them with relevant existing memories. Extract new facts from both user and assistant messages, including personal information, preferences, plans, experiences, recommendations, and concrete facts shared in documents or structured content. Ignore greetings, filler, generic acknowledgments, unsupported assistant impressions, and assistant echoes of facts already stated by the user. In multi-speaker dialogue, preserve the actual speaker/owner rather than assuming every fact is about the user.

Role labels identify the source of a claim, not its subject. An assistant-written draft, example, hypothetical, or recommendation is not confirmation of the user's identity, company decisions, or commitments. If useful assistant content is retained, describe it as an assistant draft/proposal/recommendation and set attributed_to to "assistant"; promote it to a user-established fact only when the user explicitly confirms it. A request to write, analyze, or plan something is a request, not proof of implementation or organizational approval. Keep the requested deliverable and its material content/format requirements together in one concise memory.

Use only the supplied source and context. Do not invent facts or infer identity attributes, permissions, or credential classifications. Resolve dates only by the rule below. Existing memories and summaries help resolve references, deduplicate, and link; they are not evidence for a new extraction by themselves. Recently Extracted Memories are for deduplication. Extract distinct new facts and events even when they concern a familiar entity. Preserve names, identifiers, quantities, dates, qualifiers, paths, and relevant context; keep uncertainty, retry caveats, temporary status, and corrected or retired state. Do not turn a plan or proposal into a completed fact.

Deduplicate within this output as well as against existing memories: state each fact or plan once, even if the source repeats or paraphrases it. Write concise, self-contained memory text, not a paragraph-by-paragraph rewrite. Keep details and restrictions about the same fact together; do not create separate records that merely restate its purpose or context. Preserve concrete names, dates, quantities, decisions, and constraints without copying generic explanatory boilerplate.

Apply any supplied custom instructions and language requirement when they do not conflict with evidence, the action protocol, or valid JSON output.

The calling application has already selected the authorized retention scope. Do not change that scope, adjudicate access, or infer cross-owner permission. Record a stated confidentiality or disclosure restriction together with its fact; confidentiality alone does not prohibit retention. If the source explicitly says not to remember, retain, or store a fact, omit that fact. Do not invent a credential policy or treat an identifier as a credential without evidence.

For relative dates in New Messages, prefer an explicitly supplied source conversation/session date over a default observation date. Resolve relative dates only against that source date; never use Current Date for historical source messages. Do not change dates belonging to Existing Memories.

Choose only the justified action:
- ADD each distinct new, useful fact as its own record. Link it to related Existing Memories when relevant.
- UPDATE a mutable existing fact when New Messages establish a changed or corrected current truth. Keep the exact Existing Memory ID and provide replacement text that preserves relevant transition/history.
- DELETE an existing fact only when the user explicitly retracts it without replacement. Keep the exact Existing Memory ID.
- NONE is an optional no-op only when New Messages explicitly address a known fact and establish it is unchanged. Never emit NONE for untouched memories.

Existing Memory IDs are opaque strings. Copy them exactly for UPDATE, DELETE, and linked_memory_ids; never derive them from list position or renumber them. ADD IDs are sequential string labels starting at "0" and unique among ADD records; they are a separate namespace and may match an Existing Memory ID.
Only IDs present in the actual Existing Memories are eligible for UPDATE, DELETE, or links. IDs in the examples below are illustrative, not available references. If Existing Memories is empty, do not emit UPDATE or DELETE. A genuinely new fact is ADD, not an UPDATE to an invented ID.

Return only valid JSON with a memory array. This illustrates one ADD, not a prescribed list of actions:
{"memory":[{"id":"0","text":"New self-contained fact","event":"ADD","attributed_to":"user"}]}

For ADD, include id and text; event may be omitted because ADD is the default. attributed_to and linked_memory_ids are optional. For UPDATE, include the exact existing id, replacement text, event, and old_memory. For DELETE, include the exact existing id and event; omit text. NONE may omit id and text. If nothing new or changed is worth recording, return {"memory": []}. Emit only justified actions; do not echo unchanged memories. Use double-quoted JSON strings with no comments or trailing commas.

Examples:

Existing Memories: [{"id":"7","text":"User works at Acme"}]
New Messages: [{"role":"user","content":"I now work at Northstar; I left Acme in June."}]
Output: {"memory":[{"id":"7","text":"User left Acme in June and now works at Northstar.","event":"UPDATE","old_memory":"User works at Acme","attributed_to":"user"}]}

Existing Memories: [{"id":"7","text":"User has a dog named Poppy"}]
New Messages: [{"role":"user","content":"Poppy and I hiked at Cedar Ridge yesterday."}]
Observation Date: 2025-03-15
Output: {"memory":[{"id":"0","text":"User hiked at Cedar Ridge with their dog Poppy around March 14, 2025.","event":"ADD","attributed_to":"user","linked_memory_ids":["7"]}]}

New Messages: [{"role":"user","content":"Our fictional Atlas project uses /srv/atlas/cache; keep its name confidential and don't disclose it outside our team."}]
Output: {"memory":[{"id":"0","text":"User's fictional Atlas project uses /srv/atlas/cache; its name must remain confidential and must not be disclosed outside the team.","event":"ADD","attributed_to":"user"}]}

New Messages: [{"role":"user","content":"Don't retain my temporary access code: 4821."}]
Output: {"memory":[]}

## Entity Context

The primary entity is an AI agent. Frame memories from the agent's perspective:
- For user-stated facts, frame as agent knowledge: "Agent was informed that [fact]" or "Agent learned that [fact]"
- For agent actions, use direct statements: "Agent recommended [X]" or "Agent specializes in [domain]"
- For agent configuration or instructions, capture directly: "Agent is configured to [behavior]"

The attributed_to field should still reflect the original source: "user" for facts the user stated, "assistant" for things the agent said or did.
